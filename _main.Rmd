<!-- ======================================================= -->
## About this handbook {-}

<span style="color: brown;">**This is an open-access R reference manual for applied epidemiologists and public health practitioners.**</span>

**This book strives to:**  

* Serve as a quick R code reference manual  
* Provide task-centered examples for addressing common epidemiological problems  
* Assist epidemiologists transitioning to R from SAS, STATA, SPSS, and Excel  
* Be accessible in settings with low internet-connectivity via an **offline version** ([instructions here][Download book and data])  

**How is this different than other R books?**  

* It is written by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists - leveraging experience in local, national, academic, and emergency settings  
* It provides examples of epidemic curves, transmission chains, epidemic modeling and projections, age and sex pyramids and standardization, record matching, outbreak detection, survey analysis, causal diagrams, survival analysis, GIS basics, phylogenetic trees, automated reports, etc...

# Dashboards with R Markdown { }

THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "flexdashboard_output.png"))
```

This page will cover the basic use of the **flexdashboard** package, which allows production of interactive dashboards from an R Markdown script with minimal complexity.  

Links to comprehensive tutorials on using **flexdashboard** can be found in the Resources section. Below we give an example of building a dashboard to explore the case `linelist` data.  


## Preparation

### Load packages {-}  

In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary and loads it for use. You can also load packages with `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,            
  here,
  tidyverse,
  flexdashboard
)

```

### Import data {-}

We import the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to download the data to follow step-by-step, see instructions in the [Download book and data] page. The dataset is imported using the `import()` function from the **rio** package. See the page on [Import and export] for various ways to import data.

```{r, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the linelist
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.xlsx")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```


## Begin  

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "flexdashboard_new1.png"))
```


```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "flexdashboard_new2.png"))
```
